This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About repo

This repo was created to showcase the issue with graphql-js@16 and relay-compiler.

## Instructions

`yarn` or `npm install`

`yarn relay` or `npm run relay`

here you gonna get __Invalid AST Node__ error

`yarn add -D graphql@15.7.2` or `npm install --save-dev graphql@15.7.2`

`yarn relay` or `npm run relay`

now it has worked and `src/__generated__` has been created
